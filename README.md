# LLM

## Description
### This repo allows you to create LLM Model API which runs on Google Colab.

With this LLM can be used in the following manner
```
$ llm = LLM()
```

 - Currently, the Quantized Version of LLAMA2 is hardcoded within the code but can be customized to support any model. 
- I'll add a tutorial on how to use vector embeddings as well maybe in the same repo or other repo.

## How to use it?
